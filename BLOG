  <p>If you're lucky or connected, you can get an invite. But I wasn't so lucky OR connected my first 2 years so i'm here to help you out.<br><br>First, plan out which shows are the most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A P BUDGET.<br><br>If you're worrying about blowing your p bucks the whole time, you won't have fun. Check out prices, days,and times before the shows and prioritize the showcases you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your p tickets and get excited!</p>

  <p>Always be true to your own sense of style. If you don't, you'll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, P Fashion Show is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new line.<br><br>Also, it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
